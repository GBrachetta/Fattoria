This is the website of Fattoria di Collemezzano, an agroturismo located in the heart of Tuscany, Italy. Agriturismos are typically Italian. They are "farm-stays" and have been (at least until recently) Italy's best-kept accommodation secret. They provide not just accommodation but a way to experience Italian countryside. Fattoria di Collemezzano is an independently owned estate around Cecina, just in the border between the provinces of Pisa and Livorno in Tuscany.

# <b>UX</b>
## STRATEGY PLANE
## To whom is this website addressed

- Tourists.
- Families (with pets).
- For average 2 weeks periods.
- Mostly during the summer holidays, but not limited to it.
- Predominantly Europeans: Italian, Dutch, German, French, Swiss and in general people who would be able to reach it at a reasonable driving distance.
- People travelling by car: they will visit points of interest, restaurants, landmarks, beaches around.

## Is the content relevant?

- It must clearly provide practical information.
- It must describe and depict facilities and common spaces.
- It must stress that it is children and pet friendly.
- It must show points of interest.
    - Landmarks
    - Beaches
    - Touristic attractions
    - Shopping options
- It must show that it is a family owned business and as such there’s immediate response to all needs and direct contact.
- It must stress on a relaxed, holiday-like approach, not institutional.
- It must provide clear visual information of the location.
- It should display reviews or comments from other users, to give the customer the possibility to relate to people with positive experiences.

## Is the technology appropriate?

People searching for a holiday destination take time in making an informed decision and they generally rely on a website with descriptions and a rich visual content. For many, this is the only holiday they have a year and so they require extensive information on what to do in the resort and nearby.

## What makes Fattoria di Collemezzano so special?

There’s a lot of competition in the Agriturismo industry in Italy and many oﬀer excellent value, but we can stress how our estate is a traditional, historic building with a lot of space, comfortable apartments and diverse areas of recreation. We can also emphasise the excellent location, near the sea but at very short distance from culturally relevant places (Florence, Siena, Pisa, Livorno, Lucca). This is relevant especially for days with weather not appropriate for typical summer activities or for stays oﬀ-season.

## What are the tech considerations?

We would like to make a strong visual impact.
Some of the challenges we would like to tackle are:

- Video landing page, for an immersive ﬁrst impression.
- Static photo on mobile-sized devices to avoid high data consumption.
- Suﬃcient photos showing what the client can expect, but due to the number of pictures we plan to have, we would like to compact them using elements like carousels so they don’t become overwhelming or intrusive.

Our user will probably favour desktop browsing over mobile due to the nature of the information they’re looking for.

## Why would a user want this?

Most people go on holidays and there’s a lot on oﬀer. We cannot pretend to be the best but will show with honesty and with a personal and approachable touch what we can oﬀer.

## Who else is doing this?

There are a lot of people doing this, but at the same time there are a lot of people wanting it.<br>
The amount of places on oﬀer is big, but not unlimited and due to the nature of a Hotel, there are limited places and availability.<br>
It’s not a matter of if they will choose us or not, it’s rather a matter of being amongst the ﬁrst ones chosen when comparing diﬀerent alternatives.<br>
Often Agriturismos show a very much business-like approach and they lose the personal touch of a family-run company.

## Research

For this project some research has been carried on. The participants gave the following items relevance, in order of importance:

### What do they want to find?
1. General information
2. Photos
3. Degree of comfort
4. Price
5. Location and points of interest nearby
6. Reviews

### Content importance
1. Photos
2. Price and reservation or information request options
3. Amenities (playground, swimming-pool, spaces for children)
4. Activities and places of interest
5. Contact details

### What determines their choice?
1. Size and comfort of the apartment
2. Amenities (playground, swimming-pool, spaces for children)
3. Price
4. Distance to poinst of interest
5. Personalised treatment
6. Organised activities

## What makes a good user experience?

- Finding straightforward and suﬃcient information.
- Finding good images and descriptions.
- Finding the advantages of the place compared to others.
- Finding clear information regarding price.
- Finding an easy way to get in touch and make a reservation.
- The application will probably be used just once, so it has to make the right impact immediately and stand out.
- It has to appeal to an emotional response.

## What’s worth doing?

- Well-presented imagery
- An appealing, immersive landing page (video)
- The inclusion of a map with which the user can interact.
- Easy to ﬁnd, straightforward form
- Clean and concrete navigation.
- Not excessive content, not excessive text.

## Priorities

- Create presence
- Create a network of customers (a happy customer will return and recommend our business)

# Features Implemented

## Common features
- Each page contains a responsive navigation bar with logo on the top left. For mobile-sized devices a button on the top-right expands a menu with links to the different pages on the website. On larger devices the expanded menu is shown instead.
- Every page contains a footer with contact information on the left and links to social media on the right by way of social media icons (the owner currently only uses Facebook, links to Twitter and Instagram land on their homepages). 
- There's copyright information beneath.

## Homepage

- On mobile devices there's a hero image with overlay text covering the surface of the device.
- On larger displays the hero static image is replaced by a fluid video hosted externally, with the same overlay as the mobile version. (The static image takes over on mobile devices to save user's data in case they are browsing using mobile networks).
- Immediately beneath there's a carousel with slides and general descriptive text of what Fattoria di Collemezzano has to offer.
- Underneath there's an interactive map with the location of the resort and brief descriptive text.
- Beneath this there's a vertical accordion with different titles. Each tab has a photo and a longer description. All of them are initially collapsed on loading. This has been done to avoid clutter, since the information provided here is more extensive regarding points of interest around the Fattoria (art and culture, beaches, thermal waters, sport activities).

## About

- The first visible content is a photo of the owner and a personal message.
- Beneath there are photos of the different facilities to be encountered in the Fattoria, accompanied by descriptive text.
- Underneath there's a section with reviews from previous customers.

## Apartments

- The four small sections of this page display each a single image of each of the apartments offered, brief descriptive text and a call to action button leading to find out more information about each of the units.

## Individual Apartments

- Each of the four Individual Apartments page displays a carousel with several photos of the apartment and more extensive descriptions.
- There's a clear indication of the price of the apartment and a call to action button to request more information or proceed with a booking. This button leads to the form contained in the Contact page.

## Contact

- The contact page contains a form with validation with several options to request information or make a booking, including start and end date of the desired rental and other options.

## Color Palette

![Color Palette](./readme_imgs/palette.png)

The colour palette used include different shades of typically Tuscan colours (also known as Siena colours) plus the addition of a complementary shade of turquoise for active menu items and active social media icons.

## Fonts

- The font-family chosen for the titles is Sacramento, a cursive font with an informal and cosy touch.
- For almost all text, the choice was Lato for its good legibility at light weight.
- Finally the only occurence of the third font-family, Josefin Slab, was used to underline the slogan "Welcome <strong>to your second home</strong>.

# Features to implement in the future

- Fully functional form with captcha (Javascript required)
- Reviews linked to Tripadvisor or similar (More technology needed)
- Email sent back acknowledging request for booking or information
- Additional languages pages (requires professional translator)
