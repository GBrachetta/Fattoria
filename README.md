This is the website of Fattoria di Collemezzano, an agroturismo located in the heart of Tuscany, Italy.
Agriturismos are typically Italian. They are "farm-stays" and have been (at least until recently) Italy's best-kept accomodation secret. They provide not just accomodation but a way to experience Italian countryside.
Fattoria di Collemezzano is an independently-owned estate around Cecina, just in the border between the provinces of Pisa and Livorno in Tuscany.

# <b>UX</b>

## To whom is this website addressed

- Turists.
- Families (with pets).
- For average 2 weeks periods.
- Mostly during the summer holidays, but not limited to it.
- Predominantly Europeans: Italian, Dutch, German, French, Swiss and in general people who would be able to reach it at a reasonable driving distance.
- People travelling by car: they will visit points of interest, restaurants, landmarks, beaches around.

## Is the content relevant?

- It has to clearly provide practical information.
- It has to describe and depict facilities and common spaces.
- It has to stress that it is children and pet friendly.
- It has to show points of interest.
    - Landmarks
    - Beaches
    - Touristic attractions
    - Shopping options
- It has to show that it is a family owned business and as such there’s immediate response to all needs and direct contact.
- It has to stress on a relaxed, holiday-like approach, not institutional.
- It has to provide clear isual information of the location.
- It should display reviews or comments from other users, to give the customer the possibility to relate to people with positive experiences.

## Is the technology appropriate?

People searching for a holiday destination take time in making an informed decision and they generally rely on a website with descriptions and a rich visual content.
For many, this is the only holiday they have a year and so they require extensive information on what to do in the resort and nearby.

## What makes Fattoria di Collemezzano so special?

There’s a lot of competition in the Agriturismo industry in Italy and many oﬀer excellent value, but we can stress how our estate is a traditional, historic building with a lot of space, comfortable apartments and diverse areas of recreation.
We can also emphasise the excellent location, near the sea but at very short distance from culturally relevant places (Florence, Siena, Pisa, Livorno, Lucca). This is relevant especially for days with weather not appropriate for typical summer activities or for stays oﬀ-season.

## What are the tech considerations?

We would like to make a strong visual impact.
Some of the challenges we would like to tackle are:

- Video landing page, for an immersive ﬁrst impression.
- Static photo on mobile-sized devices to avoid high data consumption.
- Suﬃcient photos showing what the client can expect, but due to the amount of pictures we plan to have, we would like to compact them using elements like carousels so they don’t become overwhelming or intrusive.
• Our user will probably favour desktop browsing over mobile due to the nature of the information they’re looking for.

## Why would a user want this?

Most people go on holidays and there’s a lot on oﬀer. We cannot pretend to be the best but will show with honesty and with a personal and approachable touch what we can oﬀer.

## Who else is doing this?

There are a lot of people doing this, but at the same time there are a lot of people wanting it.<br>
The amount of places on oﬀer is big, but not unlimited and due to the nature of a Hotel, there are limited places and availability.<br>
It’s not a matter of if they will choose us or not, it’s rather a matter of being amongst the ﬁrst ones chosen when comparing diﬀerent alternatives.<br>
Often Agriturismos show a very much business-like approach and they lose the personal touch of a family-run company.

## Research

For this project some research has been carried on. The participants gave the following items relevance, in order of importance:

### What do they want to find?
1. General information
2. Photos
3. Degree of comfort
4. Price
5. Location and points of interest nearby
6. Reviews

### Content importance
1. Photos
2. Price and reservation or information request options
3. Amenities (playground, swimming-pool, spaces for children)
4. Activities and places of interest
5. Contact details

### What determines their choice?
1. Size and comfort of the apartment
2. Amenities (playground, swimming-pool, spaces for children)
3. Price
4. Distance to poinst of interest
5. Personalised treatment
6. Organised activities

## What makes a good user experience?

- Finding straightforward and suﬃcient information. 
- Finding good images and descriptions.
- Finding the advantages of the place compared to others.
- Finding clear information regarding price.
- Finding an easy way to get in touch and make a reservation.
- The application will probably be used just once, so it has to make the right impact immediately and stand out.
- It has to appeal to an emotional response.

## What’s worth doing?

- Well presented imagery
- An appealing, immersive landing page (video)
- The inclusion of a map with which the user can interact.
- Easy to ﬁnd, straightforward form
- Clean and concrete navigation.
- Not excessive content, not excessive text.

## Priorities

- Create presence
- Create a network of customers (a happy customer will return and recommend our business)
